#Lab:
# Write a Python program to access values between index 1 and 5 in a tuple.

my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)

result = my_tuple[1:6]  

print("Values between index 1 and 5:", result)

# Write a Python program to access alternate values between index 1 and 5 in a tuple.



my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)


result = my_tuple[1:6:2]  # Slicing 


print("Alternate values between index 1 and 5:", result)


#Practical Examples: 11) Write a Python program to access values between index 1 and 5 in a tuple. 


my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)

result = my_tuple[1:6]
print("Values between index 1 and 5:", result)

# Write a Python program to access the value from the last index in a tuple.


my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)

last_value = my_tuple[-1]

print("Value at the last index:", last_value)
